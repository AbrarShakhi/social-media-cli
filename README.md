# social_media_cli
#### A simple social media command line interface app

This is my project I did in the Data Structures course at my university. We are required to create a program (in a single file) using the data structures that our instructor taught in class.

#### how to run ?
* clone this project and run `Makefile`
* or run this `g++ src/*.cpp -o bin.out` and then `./bin.out`

> **_NOTE:_** We are required to make this project into a single file. But here I split the 'classes' and 'functions' into different files. So, if the project doesn't work, there might be a problem with the 'include section'.

In this project, users can:
* Sign in and sign up.
* Publish a post,
* Follow people,
* Like posts,
* View mutual friend suggestions,
* Find users and more.
